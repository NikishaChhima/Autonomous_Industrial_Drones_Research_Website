# Autonomous_Industrial_Drones_Research_Website

<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project required us to create a website where users could understand and explore our topic choice of 'Autonomous Industrial Drones for Infrastructure Inspections in Urban Areas'. We included discussions relating to its opportunities, risks, choices and ethical reflections.
<br />


<h2>Languages Used</h2>

- HTML/CSS

<h2>Group Project Distribution:</h2>
As this was a group assignment (3 people, including myself), we needed to ensure even work distribution. I was the group leader, so we discussed what their preference was. They both concluded that they would prefer researching and writing while I did all the coding for the website. This was my first time coding with HMTL/CSS.
